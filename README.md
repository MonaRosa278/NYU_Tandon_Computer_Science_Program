![NYU_Tandon_Online](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68399465/147694581-6728427f-7f80-41ab-b338-300320a49228.png)

## Program Overview 
This is a highly competitive program. The program covers a wide range of computer science topics, including data structures and algorithms, discrete math, networking, and operating systems. If you don't have any programming experience previously, it can be very difficult. Lots of new concepts and topics were introduced into the course, particularly in the second half of the program. 
You are expected to spend 80+ hours on those materials each week. To receive a certificate, you must complete the bridge program with a B+, which means you must outperform approximately 75% - 80% of your cohort.

● Fundamentals of system hardware
● Number Systems
● Compilation and Execution process
● Data types and Expressions
● Branching statements
